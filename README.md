# Python-EDA-and-ML
<h4> In this project i preformed advanced analysis on dataframe that hase taken from kaggle and called "Telco Customer Churn".
  
This project has done in jupyter lab enviroment.
  
In order my mission to try predict which customer will churn the company, i used some python libarries like: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn, seaborn and more...

The analysis process including some critical steps like: looking and cleaning the data, perform exploratory data analysis(EDA) and finding interesting relationships & correlations, and finally run the machine learning algorithms & test their resaults.
  
In my presentation file I answered the questions asked by the lecturer.
